Hello! I am a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) working in the direction of cognitively-based AI. 

I specifically work in the areas of commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning (with [Kenneth Kwok](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth-Kwok-2) and [Erik Cambria](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00927)) and scene understanding (with [Basura Fernando](https://basurafernando.github.io/) and [Cheston Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Up0UYEYAAAAJ)).

<div><h1>Research</h1></div>
A common theme of my research is to:
1. Identify a cognitive capability or functionality observed in humans and of relevance to building more effective AI.
2. Integrate the identified capability in existing AI methods through proposing new (or modifying existing) computational blocks/operations, training methods and learning resources.
3. Demonstrate the integrated capability on relevant tasks and benchmarks (and with multiple backbone AI architectrures where applicable).

The motive is to contribute towards a blueprint for building more intelligent and reliable AI that is informed by cognitive science and complementary to machine learning developments. 

To know more of the work I've done along with my wonderful collaborators, please have a look at the [Publications](/publications/) section. 

My CV is available [here](/cv/).

<h2 style="margin-top:0;"> About me </h2>
Hello! I am a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) working in the direction of cognitively-based AI. 

My research interest is in building AI models that can -- (i) reason with **human-level** capabilities in a **reliable** and **interpretable** manner and (ii) **continually learn or update** their world knowledge through experience and any additional task-level supervision.

At A*STAR, I specifically work on:
1. Developing a **commonsense knowledge resource** for machine reading applications (advised by [Kenneth Kwok](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth-Kwok-2) and [Erik Cambria](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00927)).
2. **Functionally integrating relevant cognitive phenomena** to build more effective computer vision models for scene understanding tasks (advised by [Basura Fernando](https://basurafernando.github.io/) and [Cheston Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Up0UYEYAAAAJ)).

My CV is available [here](/cv/).
