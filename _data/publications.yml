      - "[[Code]](https://github.com/shantanuj/TDAM_Top_down_attention_module)"
    descript: "Introduces top-down attention to enable models to <i><b>'look again' and attend to salient objects or features</b></i> (at multiple levels of the hierarchy) based on task or contextual information. Also reduces entropy of output activations and makes channel <i><b>co-activation b/w input and outputs more selective </b></i>(analysis in supplemental)."
    
  - title: "A Probabilistic-Logic based Commonsense Representation Framework for Modelling Inferences with Multiple Antecedents and Varying Likelihoods"
    authors: "Shantanu Jaiswal, Liu Yan, Dongkyu Choi, Kenneth Kwok"
    venue: "*arXiv preprint*, 2022."

      - "[Code & data pending agency approval]"
    descript: "Introduces a probabilistic-logic based representation scheme to represent world knowledge with <i><b>different 'certainty levels'</b></i> and perform <i><b>context-dependent non-monotonic inferences</b></i> (wherein likelihoods can change with new contextual/situational knowledge)."
 
  - title: "What do CNNs gain by imitating the visual development of primate infants?"
    authors: "Shantanu Jaiswal, Dongkyu Choi, Basura Fernando"
    venue: "In *British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)*, 2020."

    descript: "Analyses a <i><b>growth-based training strategy</b></i> wherein models are grown and inputs are gradually refined over course of training (potentially allowing <i><b>'coarse global' patterns to be identified first</b></i> and then 'finer' ones; visualization of induced filters during training in supplemental)."
