      - "[[Code]](https://github.com/shantanuj/TDAM_Top_down_attention_module)"
    descript: "Introduces top-down attention to enable models to 'look again' (at multiple levels of the hierarchy) and attend to salient features based on task or contextual information."
    
  - title: "A Probabilistic-Logic based Commonsense Representation Framework for Modelling Inferences with Multiple Antecedents and Varying Likelihoods"

      - "[Code & data pending agency approval]"
    descript: "Introduces a probabilistic-logic based representation scheme to represent world knowledge with different 'certainty levels' and perform context-dependent and non-monotonic inferences (likelihoods can change with new context/situational knowledge)."
