Hello! I am a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) working in the direction of cognitively-based AI. 

My research interest is in building AI models that can -- (i) reason with **human-level** capabilities in a **reliable** and **interpretable** manner and (ii) **continually learn or update** their world knowledge through experience and any additional task-level supervision.

At A*STAR, I have specifically been working on:
1. Developing a **commonsense knowledge resource** for machine reading tasks (advised by [Kenneth Kwok](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth-Kwok-2) and [Erik Cambria](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00927)).
2. **Functionally integrating relevant cognitive phenomena** into computer vision models to make them more effective on scene understanding tasks (advised by [Basura Fernando](https://basurafernando.github.io/) and [Cheston Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Up0UYEYAAAAJ)).

To know more of the work I've done along with my wonderful collaborators, please have a look at the [Publications](/publications/) section. 

My CV is available [here](/cv/).
