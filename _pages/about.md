Hello! I'm Shantanu (or Shan for short). I work as a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing). 

I'm interested in building AI models that, given environmental scenes or textual passages, can:
1. 'Understand' and 'reason' on them with human-level capabilities to answer relevant questions in a **reliable** and **interpretable** manner.
2. **Continually learn or update** their world knowledge through given experience and any additional supervision. 
	
At A*STAR, I specifically work on -- i) developing a **commonsense knowledge resource** for machine reading applications, and ii) **integrating cognitive phenomena in computer vision** models to make them more effective for scene understanding tasks.

To know more about my work, please have a look at the [Publications](/publications/) section. In case you would like to collaborate or have any questions/suggestions, please drop me an email.
