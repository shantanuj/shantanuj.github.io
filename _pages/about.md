Hello! I am a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) working in the direction of cognitively-based AI. 

My research interest is to build AI models that can -- i) "reason" on scenes or passages with **human-level capabilities** in a **reliable** and **interpretable** manner and ii) **continually learn or update** their world knowledge through experience and any additional task-specific supervision.

At A*STAR, I have specifically been working on -- i) developing a **commonsense knowledge resource** for machine reading applications, and ii) **functionally integrating relevant cognitive phenomena** into computer vision models to make them more effective on scene understanding tasks. 

To know more of my work along with my wonderful collaborators, please have a look at the [Publications](/publications/) section. 

My CV is available [here](/cv/).
