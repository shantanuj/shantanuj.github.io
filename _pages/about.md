Hello! I'm a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) working in the direction of cognitively-inspired AI. 

I'm specifically interested in building AI models that given environmental scenes or textual passages can:
1. **"Understand"** and **"reason"** on them with human-level capabilities to answer relevant questions in a **reliable** and **interpretable** manner.
2. **Continually learn or update** their world knowledge through given experience and any additional supervision. 

At A*STAR, I've been working on -- i) developing a **commonsense knowledge resource** for machine reading applications, and ii) integrating relevant **cognitive priors in computer vision** models to make them more effective on scene understanding tasks.
