Hello! I'm a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) working in the direction of cognitively-inspired AI. 

I'm interested in building AI models that can -- i) "reason" on scenes or passages with human-level capabilities and in a **reliable** and **interpretable** manner, and ii) **continually learn/update** their world knowledge through environmental experience and any task-level supervision.

At A*STAR, I've specifically been working on -- i) developing a **commonsense knowledge resource** for machine reading applications, and ii) integrating relevant **cognitive phenomena to make computer vision** models more effective on scene understanding tasks. 

To know more, please have a look at the [Publications](/publications/) section. 

My CV is available [here](/cv/).
