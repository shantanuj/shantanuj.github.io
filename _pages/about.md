Hello! I'm a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's Social and Cognitive Computing Department. 

I'm interested in building AI models that, given environmental scenes or textual passages, can:
	1. 'Understand' and 'reason' on them with human-level capabilities to answer relevant questions in a **reliable** and **interpretable** manner.
	2. Continually learn or update their world knowledge through given experience and any additional supervision. 
	
At A*STAR, I specifically work on:
	1. Development of a commonsense knowledge resource for machine-reading applications and NLU tasks.
	2. Integrating relevant cognitive phenomena in computer vision models to improve their performance, interpretability and efficiency on scene understanding tasks.

To know more about the work I've done along with my wonderful collaborators, please have a look at the [Publications](/_publications/) section. 

If you would like to collaborate or have any questions/suggestions, please drop me an email at <first_name>12jswl at gmail. Also, a more formal CV can be downloaded from [here](/files/CV_Shantanu_Jaiswal.pdf).
