Hello! I am a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) working in the direction of cognitively-based AI. 

I specifically work in the areas of commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning (with [Kenneth Kwok](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth-Kwok-2) and [Erik Cambria](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00927)) and scene understanding (with [Basura Fernando](https://basurafernando.github.io/) and [Cheston Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Up0UYEYAAAAJ)).

A common theme of my research is to:
1. Identify a cognitive capability or functionality observed in humans and of relevance to building more effective AI.
2. Integrate the identified capability in existing AI methods through proposing new (or modifying existing) computational blocks/operations, training methods and learning resources.
3. Demonstrate the integrated capability on relevant tasks and benchmarks (and with multiple backbone AI architectrures where applicable).

The motive is to contribute towards a blueprint for building more intelligent and reliable AI that is informed by cognitive science and complementary to machine learning developments. 

To know more of the work I've done along with my wonderful collaborators, please have a look at the [Publications](/publications/) section. 

My CV is available [here](/cv/).
