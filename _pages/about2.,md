Hello! I'm a research engineer at A*STAR Singapore's [Social and Cognitive Computing Department](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/social-cognitive-computing) working in the direction of cognitively-inspired AI. 

I'm interested in building AI models that can: 
1. "Understand" and "reason" on scenes or passages with human-level capabilities in a reliable and interpretable manner.
2. Continually learn or update their world knowledge through environmental experience and any further supervision. 

At A*STAR, I've specifically been working on -- i) developing a commonsense knowledge resource for machine reading applications, and ii) integrating relevant cognitive phenomena into computer vision models to make them more effective on scene understanding tasks. 

To know more, please have a look at the [Publications](/publications/) section. 

My CV is available [here](/cv/).
